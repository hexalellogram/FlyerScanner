# SDHacks Planning

## Backend Design

- 1 ics file per event
    - can modify existing ics file to modify existing event (hopefully)
    - ics will be generated by ical4j (see below)
- ical4j usage
    - each event is going to have a ComparableCalendar object (extends ical4j Calendar, not Java Calendar)
    - to export to ics, use CalendarOutput: See ["Generating a Calendar File"](https://github.com/ical4j/ical4j/wiki/Examples#Generating_a_calendar_file)
    - Store ComparableCalendar objects in a PriorityQueue sorted by start Date (note: Date is a class in ical4j, and it is Comparable) of the event
- EventStorage class for frontend and TensorFlow processing to hook into
    - handles all i/o for events
        - creating new events
        - modifying existing events
    - public addEvent()
        - adds a new event to the list
        - parameters: String for title, String for date, anything else??
        - if event already exists, call modifyEvent() instead
    - private modifyEvent()
        - modifies an existing event
        - parameters: same as addEvent()
    - private eventExists()
        - returns true or false depending on whether the event exists or not
    - public deleteEvent()
        - deletes an existing event
- ComparableCalendar extends Calendar implements Comparable
    - compareTo based on Dates of the VEvent

## Ideas for Improvement

- Sorting the list of already added events by different criteria (Name, Start Date, etc.)
    - would need a KD tree (which is why we're not doing this in the first iteration)
- Handling fliers for recurring events
